  - A thoughtful, artistic composition that bridges technology and heritage
  - Could include elements like: vintage Vietnamese elements mixed with modern tech (terminal/code)
  - Portrait-style image with Vietnamese cultural elements and modern workspace
  - Abstract representation of "unconventional paths" - perhaps a winding road or unconventional route
  - Split composition: traditional Vietnamese imagery on one side, modern tech workspace on the other
  - Artistic rendering of General Gi√°p's strategic maps alongside modern development tools

### 2. Optional supplementary images:
