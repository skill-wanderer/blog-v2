## 🚀 About This Blog

Welcome to [**The Skill-Wanderer Journey**](https://wanderings.skill-wanderer.com)! This is a personal tech blog where I share insights, experiences, and learnings from my adventures in technology. From home data centers and Kubernetes clusters to development workflows and infrastructure projects, this blog serves as both a documentation of my journey and a resource for fellow tech enthusiasts.



## 🔄 From WordPress to Astro: A Strategic Migration

The decision to migrate the Skill-Wanderer blog from WordPress to Astro was a strategic choice driven by the pursuit of superior performance, greater developer control, and better alignment with the platform's modern, streamlined technology stack. This move prioritizes a faster, more efficient user experience and a more manageable development workflow.

### Key Drivers for the Migration:

**Performance and SEO**: Astro is engineered for content-heavy websites, focusing on maximizing performance and search engine optimization. It achieves this by shipping minimal to no JavaScript by default, which results in significantly faster page load times—a critical factor for user retention and SEO rankings.

**Developer Control and Modern Stack**: Moving to Astro provides a more controllable and performant solution compared to WordPress. It integrates seamlessly into a modern development workflow that utilizes Git for version control, allowing for more robust and collaborative processes. This aligns with the overall technical strategy of using contemporary frameworks like Nuxt.js for the main hub and preparing for future scalability.

**Resource Efficiency**: The migration reflects the core development principle of resourcefulness and efficiency. By leveraging a framework optimized for content, the platform can deliver a high-quality blog experience without the overhead and complexity that can sometimes be associated with a full-scale CMS like WordPress.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This blog is built with modern web technologies for optimal performance and developer experience:

| Technology | Purpose | Why We Use It |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **[Astro](https://astro.build/)** | Static site generator | Zero JS by default, excellent performance |
| **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** | Type-safe JavaScript | Better developer experience and code reliability |
| **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** | Utility-first CSS framework | Rapid styling with consistent design system |
| **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)** | Markdown with embedded components | Rich content with interactive elements |
| **[Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)** | High-performance image processing | Optimized images for faster loading |

     'DevOps',
     'Your New Category',  // Add here
     // ... other categories
   ];
   ```
3. The category will automatically appear in the blog navigation

### 📸 Adding Images

- **Hero images**: Place in `public/images/blog/[post-slug]/hero.jpg`
- **Content images**: Place in `public/images/blog/[post-slug]/[image-name].jpg`
- **Author avatars**: Place in `public/images/authors/[author-slug]-avatar.jpg`

See the [Images README](public/images/README.md) for detailed guidelines.

## 🎨 Customization

### Design System

The blog uses a custom color palette defined in `tailwind.config.mjs`:

- **Dark Mode Colors**: Primary backgrounds and text colors optimized for readability
- **Light Mode Colors**: Clean, modern light theme elements
- **Brand Colors**: Skill-Wanderer orange accents (`#ff6b35`)

### Key Design Principles

- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **High contrast for accessibility**
- **Clean typography optimized for reading**
- **Fast loading with optimized images**

## 🚀 CI/CD

This repository includes automated GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment:

### Workflows

- **CI** (`ci.yml`): Runs on every push and PR
  - Builds the Astro application
  - Tests Docker build process
  - Uploads build artifacts
  
- **Multi-Architecture Build** (`build-and-push.yml`): Builds and pushes Docker images
  - Supports both **x86_64** and **ARM64** architectures
  - Pushes to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
  - Automatically triggered on pushes to main/master
  - Creates multi-platform images for diverse deployment environments
  
- **Dependency Updates** (`dependency-update.yml`): Weekly automated dependency maintenance
  - Updates npm dependencies
  - Creates PRs with security fixes
  - Validates builds after updates

### Container Registry

Multi-architecture Docker images are available at:
```
ghcr.io/skill-wanderer/blog-v2:latest
```

Pull the image:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/skill-wanderer/blog-v2:latest
```

### 🔐 GitHub Secrets Configuration

To enable Firebase functionality and proper CI/CD builds, configure the following GitHub repository secrets:

1. **Navigate to your GitHub repository settings**
   - Go to `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions`

2. **Add the following repository secrets:**

   | Secret Name | Value |
   |-------------|-------|
   | `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | `AIzaSyCr_1Fo6hzJDsKZrjw2u3HlrFhBnfeHmxE` |
   | `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | `skill-wanderer-hub.firebaseapp.com` |
   | `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | `skill-wanderer-hub` |
   | `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | `skill-wanderer-hub.appspot.com` |
   | `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | `801841516442` |
   | `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | `1:801841516442:web:77c33043420a581b95f423` |
   | `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` | `G-XZETSK476Y` |

3. **Why these secrets are needed:**
   - These Firebase configuration values are required for the email subscription functionality
   - The CI/CD workflows use these secrets to build the application with proper Firebase integration
   - Docker builds require these values as build arguments to embed them into the static site

4. **Security Note:**
   - These are Firebase client-side configuration values, not server-side API keys
   - They are safe to include in client-side bundles as they're designed for public exposure
   - However, using GitHub secrets ensures consistent configuration across environments

```

#### Option 2: Building Locally

Build and run the blog using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t blog-v2 .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name skill-wanderer-blog \
  -p 8080:80 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  blog-v2
```

#### Option 3: Using Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  blog:
    image: ghcr.io/skill-wanderer/blog-v2:latest
    # Or build locally: build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
