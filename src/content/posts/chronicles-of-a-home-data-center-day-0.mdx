Welcome to Day 0 of our home data center journey! After the thorough planning and assessment we completed in [Day -1](/blog/chronicles-of-a-home-data-center-day-1/), it's time to translate those insights into concrete action. Today, we're moving from planning to implementation with a carefully crafted blueprint and a small-scale proof of concept (POC).

## From Planning to Action: The Day 0 Transition

The Day -1 planning phase helped us establish our motivations, assess our resources, and adopt an agile mindset. Now comes the exciting part: taking that first tangible step toward building your home data center. Day 0 is about creating a blueprint that serves as your technical roadmap and implementing a minimal viable product (MVP) that proves your concept works.

## Creating Your Blueprint

<Image

  alt="Creating Your Blueprint"
  class="rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-6"
/>

Your blueprint is more than just documentation—it's your strategic guide that transforms abstract ideas into concrete, actionable steps. Based on your Day -1 assessment, let's create a blueprint that's both practical and scalable.

### Core Components of Your Blueprint

**Infrastructure Foundation:**
- Primary hardware selection (the laptop, SBC, or server that will serve as your initial node)
- Network topology and connectivity requirements
- Storage strategy (local drives, NFS, or cloud hybrid)
- Power and physical environment considerations

**Software Stack:**
- Operating system choice ([Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/server), [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/), or [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/))
- Container orchestration platform ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [K3s](https://k3s.io/), or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/))
- Essential services (DNS, DHCP, monitoring, backup)
- Security framework (firewalls, VPN, authentication)

**Service Architecture:**
- Application deployment strategy
- Data flow and storage patterns
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Backup and disaster recovery approach

### MVP Definition: Your Day 0 Target

Your MVP should be the smallest possible implementation that demonstrates your core concept. Here's a practical example:

**Sample Day 0 MVP:**
"Install Ubuntu Server 22.04 on my primary laptop, configure Docker, deploy a simple web application (like [Nginx](https://nginx.org/)), and ensure it's accessible from another device on my network."

This MVP validates:
- Hardware compatibility and performance
- Network connectivity and configuration
- Basic containerization capabilities
- Remote access functionality

## Small-Scale POC Implementation

/>

Now let's implement our POC step by step. This practical approach ensures we learn by doing while keeping the scope manageable.

### Step 1: Environment Preparation

**Hardware Setup:**
- Select your primary device (laptop, mini PC, or SBC)
- Ensure adequate ventilation and power supply
- Connect to your network via Ethernet if possible
- Have backup storage ready (USB drive for emergency recovery)

**Network Configuration:**
- Reserve a static IP address on your router
- Configure port forwarding if needed
- Document your network topology
- Test internet connectivity and speed

### Step 2: Operating System Installation

**Ubuntu Server Installation:**
```bash
# Download Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
wget https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso

# Create bootable USB (replace /dev/sdX with your USB device)
sudo dd if=ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

**Key Configuration Choices:**
- Enable SSH during installation for remote management
- Configure automatic security updates
- Install essential packages: `curl`, `wget`, `git`, `htop`
- Set up a non-root user with sudo privileges

### Step 3: Initial Setup and Configuration

<Image 
  src={setupImage}
  alt="Initial Setup and Configuration"
  class="rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-6"
/>

**System Hardening:**
```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Configure firewall
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443

# Secure SSH configuration
sudo sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

**Docker Installation:**
```bash
# Install Docker using official script
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Enable Docker service
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Step 4: Deploy Your First Service

**Simple Web Application:**
```bash
# Create a directory for your project
mkdir ~/homelab-poc
cd ~/homelab-poc

# Create a simple HTML file
cat << EOF > index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Home Data Center POC</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Home Data Center!</h1>
    <p>Day 0 POC - Successfully deployed on $(date)</p>
    <p>Server: $(hostname)</p>
</body>
</html>
EOF

# Run Nginx container
docker run -d \
  --name homelab-web \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v $(pwd)/index.html:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html:ro \
  nginx:alpine

# Verify deployment
curl http://localhost
```

## Testing and Validation

  src={testsImage}
  alt="Testing and Validation"
  class="rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-6"
/>

Your POC isn't complete until you've thoroughly tested it. This validation phase ensures your foundation is solid before building upon it.

### Connectivity Tests

**Local Network Access:**
- Test web application access from multiple devices
- Verify SSH connectivity from other machines
- Check DNS resolution and network routing
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)

**Performance Baseline:**
```bash
# System resource monitoring
htop

# Network performance test
iperf3 -s  # On server
iperf3 -c [SERVER_IP]  # On client

# Disk I/O test
sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sda
```

### Security Validation

**Basic Security Checks:**
```bash
# Check open ports
sudo netstat -tulpn

# Review firewall rules
sudo ufw status verbose

# Check running services
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```

### Documentation

Create a simple documentation file to record your setup:

```markdown
# Home Data Center POC - Day 0
