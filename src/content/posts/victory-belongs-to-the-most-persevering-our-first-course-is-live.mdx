I never once thought I would launch a course. The sheer effort seemed monumental, almost insurmountable. As a lifelong online learner, I knew the hours of painstaking work required to create even a few minutes of quality content. But the drive to build a truly honest and accessible learning space, free from the conflicts of interest plaguing online education, pushed me forward. These past few months have been a whirlwind of planning, building, and persevering to finally create something valuable for the world.

It was tough. The path was wide open, and for whatever the platform—rise or fall—every minute has been worth it.

While I've always been confident in my technical skills—spinning up a website, deploying an open-source LMS, or configuring single sign-on is familiar territory—I know that tech is supposed to solve problems, not be the problem. The real challenge, and where I invested most of my time, was in the human element: the strategic planning, the deep dive into community-building principles, and the conversations to truly understand the needs of future learners.

Juggling this with a full-time job was especially tough. Life doesn't get gentler when you start a non-profit platform; everything keeps hitting you. I had to hire a lawyer for an unexpected problem and deal with correcting flaws as my family's records were being migrated to a government cloud. The police officer handling it was extremely nice, and given the massive challenge of migrating thousands of records, I had no hard feelings, only empathy for the difficulty of his job. On top of all that, my children were sick and needed care. Through it all, the mission for Skill-Wanderer became a source of focus and purpose—a reminder of the bigger goal.

But I've always believed in Napoleon Bonaparte's words: "Victory belongs to the most persevering."

Today, I'm celebrating a small victory. The first course is launched. It's just one battle in a much larger campaign, but it marks the end of the beginning.

## Introducing: Big Picture Overview of Computer Science: Foundations of Computing

In a world focused on the newest frameworks and fastest coding languages, why start with the history of computing? Because to truly innovate, you must first understand the foundation. Knowing how we got here and why our tools work the way they do is the difference between simply writing code and being a genuine problem-solver. This course was created to provide that essential context, the "big picture" that connects all the dots.

To create a truly effective learning experience, I had to split the original course in half to avoid information overload. This first part covers everything from the earliest computing machines to the pre-internet era, setting the stage for a deep understanding of the modern digital world.

### Course Objective:
This course provides a broad, high-level understanding of foundational computer science concepts. Our objective is to equip you with knowledge of computing history, hardware fundamentals, and early programming concepts, preparing you to understand how we arrived at today's technology.

### Target Audience:
This course is designed for anyone seeking a strong foundational understanding of computer science, including:

- **Absolute Beginners** curious about the field
- **Self-Taught Developers** who wish to fill in theoretical gaps
- **Bootcamp Graduates** looking to strengthen their knowledge of formal principles
- **University Students & Graduates** from any field needing a comprehensive overview
- **Computer Science Majors & Graduates** who want to see the "big picture" or prepare for interviews

## What's Next? The Vision for a Collaborative Community

This course is the first step, the foundation. But our true vision extends far beyond a curriculum. We are building a collaborative community ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between learning and real-world impact. The second half of the course is on its way, but in parallel, we are laying the groundwork for something truly special.

**What's the best way to gain real-world experience? By working on real-world projects.**

My goal is to create a space where learners can contribute their growing skills to non-profits and early-stage startups that need a helping hand. I have already connected with a non-profit and a startup that have agreed to join once the community platform is ready. This isn't a job board; it's a place to volunteer your skills for a noble cause, build your portfolio, and make a tangible impact. It's an environment for mentorship, collaboration, and applying knowledge in a way that truly matters. While these are unpaid opportunities initially, we support and expect compensation to become part of the conversation as a project grows and succeeds.

It's a big dream, but it's the future we're building. For now, thank you for being here at the start of the journey. This is more than just our story; it's an invitation to be a part of it.

See you next time.
